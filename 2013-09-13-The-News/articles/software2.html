      <h2>Facebook's Latest Move Paves the Way for Autoplay Video Ads
      </h2>
      <h3>Facebook just took one step closer to running autoplay video ads in the News Feed. This is either great news (if you're an advertiser) or not-so-great news</h3>
      <img src="../images/facebook.jpg" alt="facebook">
      <p>
        On Thursday, Facebook began testing autoplay videos on mobile News Feeds to a small group of random users. The company has been inching towards running such ads all year. Originally, the move was reportedly planned for April at the latest, but Facebook has pushed back the date to the fall or later. The latest report pegs the timeframe at October. (As the company often points out, advertisers already run video ads on Facebook; they are just not set to play automatically.)
      </p>
      <aside class="left">"Autoplay ads are typically an irritating distraction for users,"</aside>
      <p>
        That timing is plausible in light of Thursday's announcement. Now, it is technically possible for a brand to load a video onto Facebook directly or via Instagram. The only thing that bars them from doing so is Facebook.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to Ad Age, the company is trying to persuade advertisers to create original content for the News Feed rather than simply re-running their TV ads (albeit at 15 seconds rather than the standard 30.)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Autoplay ads are typically an irritating distraction for users," he says. "Most media buyers prefer click to play video ads and relegate autoplay ads to cheap reach strategies. To be effective, video ads need to be memorable and leave a lasting imprint â€” autoplay ads with no sound are unlikely to do that."
      </p>
      <p>
        Another intriguing possibility in light of Thursday's announcement is that Facebook will allow for GIF-based ads. Facebook's platform doesn't support GIFs, and a recent workaround from Giphy was not autoplay in the old format. Even with Thursday's update, GIFs are still not supported, according to Facebook, which does not seen to keen on the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that now seems like a short step away. For all advertisers unwilling to pay $1 million and up, this might be an interesting development.
