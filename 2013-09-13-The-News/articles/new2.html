        A Johns Hopkins University dean has apologised and insisted he is "supportive of academic freedom" after ordering a cryptography professor to take down a blog post which criticised the National Security Agency.
      </p>
      <p>
        Matthew Green, an assistant research professor in JHU's department of computer science, was asked to remove a blog post from the university's servers on Monday. The entry linked to classified government documents published by the Guardian, the New York Times and ProPublica and summarised what Green called "bombshell revelations" of how the NSA is able to unlock encryption used to protect emails and other data.
      </p>
      <p>
        JHU found itself criticised for abusing academic freedom after Andrew Douglas, who has served as interim dean of the university's engineering school since July, asked Green to remove the post from the university's servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The article, which featured screengrabs of NSA documents and the NSA's logo, had been posted to Green's personal blog but also appeared on a mirror blog on JHU's website.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I am sorry that my request to you yesterday may have, in some minds, undeservedly undercut your reputation as a scholar and scientist. I am also sorry if I have raised in anyone's mind a question as to my commitment to academic freedom," Douglas wrote in a message to Green that was made public on Tuesday.
