        The Apple Store app and Apple Store web site went live after spending much of Thursday evening with a traditional "we'll be back" message while it updated with information on the ordering process. Customers ordering now were to begin receiving the phone on Sept. 20.
      </p>

        Apple on Tuesday unveiled its next-generation flagship iPhone 5s starting at $199 with customary two-year service contract, the new iPhone 5c in several colors, starting at $99, and the latest version of its iOS 7 operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Promotional pricing deals were widespread on Thursday. Walmart is selling the 5c for $79, and a 16GB 5s for $189. T-Mobile has a limited time deal for no money down on the 5c and 24 monthly payments of $22 (for a total of $528.)

        The 5c comes in green, white, blue, pink, and yellow. The phone's casings are made of a polycarbonate plastic. It is powered by Apple's A6 processor and sports an 8-megapixel camera. The 5c has Apple's 4-inch retina display and can run on 4G LTE networks.

        It will run $549 for a model purchased without a carrier plan.The iPhone 5s is not available for pre-order. Apple's latest standard-bearer is a 64-bit model powered by a zippier A7 chip and comes in gold, silver and a "space gray." Apple says the processor is twice as fast as its predecessor. Apple also included a much-expected fingerprint ID sensor in the home button on the 5s, allowing people to unlock the phone, as well as make iTunes purchases.
      </p>
      <p>
        IPhone 5s prices will run $199 for a 16-GB model, $299 for a 32-GB and $399 for a 64-GB version â€” all requiring a two-year contract.
