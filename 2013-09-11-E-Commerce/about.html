  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <section id="about">

    <p>
      From the party DJ to the lover of vinyl, Cat Scratchers has been providing pro audio gear to the Louisville area since 1972.  Bob Katz started Cat Scratchers with little more than a dream and $10 in his pocket.  Operating out of his garage, he won Best Hot New Business in 1975.  Even back then, the personal touch was critical to his success.

      Are you sure about this storm? What did your mother ever see in that kid? It's taken me almost thirty years and my entire family fortune to realize the vision of that day, my god has it been that long. Things have certainly changed around here. I remember when this was all farmland as far as the eye could see. Old man Peabody, owned all of this. He had this crazy idea about breeding pine trees. Is she pretty? Of course, from a group of Libyan Nationalists. They wanted me to build them a bomb, so I took their plutonium and in turn gave them a shiny bomb case full of used pinball machine parts.

      Erased from existence. Are you sure about this storm? Well, I guess that's everything. Thank god I found you. Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15? I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance. Please, Marty, don't tell me, no man should know too much about their own destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do understand. If I know too much about my own future I could endanger my own existence, just as you endangered yours. The storm. Don't tell me. Uh, you want me to buy a subscription to the Saturday Evening Post? Marty, I'm sorry, but the only power source capable of generating one point twenty-one gigawatts of electricity is a bolt of lightning. Well, now we gotta sneak this back into my laboratory, we've gotta get you home.
